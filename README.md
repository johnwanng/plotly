Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Introduction

In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

It will display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

There are three charts which need to be displayed using the 'samples.json' file under the 'data' folder.

The first is a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual having the following attributes:

1. Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

2. Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

3. Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

The second one is a bubble chart that displays each sample using the following attributes:

1. Use otu_ids for the x values.

2. Use sample_values for the y values.

3. Use sample_values for the marker size.

4. Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

5. Use otu_labels for the text values.

The third one which is a bonus is a gauge chart that plots the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

The demographic information together with the three charts need to be updated whenever a new sample is selected from the dropdown.
